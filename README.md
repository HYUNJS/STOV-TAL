# Exploring Scalability of Self-Training for Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization (STOV-TAL)

Code and data will be released soon (by July).

## Dataset
Here are the Google Drive links to the dataset, including features and annotations. Due to the high volume, I am looking for another way to release the features for YouTube videos (Untrimmed Kinetics).
